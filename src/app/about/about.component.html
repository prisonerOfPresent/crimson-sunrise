      Etymology of the name

      </h2>
      <p>
        Both the nouns <span class="complementary-accent-color">Arun</span> and <span class="complementary-accent-color">Vishnu</span> have their origins rooted in ancient Hindu mythology.
        <i>Aruna devan</i> is usually a reference to the <i>Sarathi</i> (charioteer) of <i>Surya devan</i>, the Sun-Deity. It is said that Aruna devan spreads light with a reddish hue, just before the actual sunrise - known as <i>Arunodayam.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        For the second noun, as the name suggests, <strong class="complementary-accent-color">Vishnu</strong> refers to the <strong>God Vishnu</strong> of the Holy Trinity, responsible for existence of reality.
        <br/>
        It is also my Father's name.
      </p>

      <p>Coming back to the first noun, <i>Aruna varnam</i> literally means the <strong>colour Red</strong> in <i><strong>Sanskrit</strong></i> and its derivatives.
        I usually think of this interpretation of the name, rather than the mythical - because that involves deities and I am not one, obviously :)</p>
      <p>I prefer the <span class="accent-color">The Crimson shade</span> of Red, specifically.</p>
